Radiotherapy, using radiation to kill cancer cells, is a key component of head and neck cancer treatment. Radiotherapy treatment plans are precisely designed to deliver a high radiation dose to tumor volumes, while minimizing any doses to healthy tissue. Adaptive Radiotherapy (ART), updating the treatment plan to adapt to patient’s anatomical changes over the 6-7 weeks of daily treatment, has been adopted by many clinics in an e↵ort to further reduce dose to healthy tissues. However, ART and the treatment re-planning process is resource-intensive, therefore, this project aims to balance resource limitations with the objective of making one re-plan most e↵ective and to gain insight into when the most e↵ective time to re-plan would be and who to re-plan. The radiotherapy treatment plans of 60 patients were assessed using both conventional dose parameter assessment and machine learning methods, such as clustering and regression tree. The analyses showed that treatment plans for target volumes and critical organs-at-risk, such as spinal cord and brainstem, are very robust against anatomical changes, while treatment plans for other organs-at-risk, like parotid glands, exhibited significant variations. Temporal changes of dose distribution was best approximated with a linear fit, suggesting that re-planning halfway the treatment would be most e↵ective. Machine learning analyses done for the right parotid gland suggests that patients with tumour in stage is 1, 2, or 4a and whose BMI has decreased over 2.37 kg/m2 and whose cancer site is within nasopharynx, oropharynx, or tonsil would most benefit in re-planning treatment dose.
